# Automating Loan Eligibility - Mini Project 4 LHL

As Part of the Lighthouse Labs Data Science Course, this project was done to learn about machine learning and model deployment on AWS EC2. 

Using the dataset found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h_jl9xqqqHflI5PsuiQd_soNYxzFfjKw/view)

## Outline
1. Hypothesis Generation 
2. Data Exploration and Visualizations
3. Data Cleaning 
4. Building a Predictive model
5. Deploying the final model.

In this project, Pandas, Pipelines, Sklearn, numpy, Matplotlib and other python libraries were used to create the model.

For deployment, I used Flask, which can be found in the test_model and final_model python files.
